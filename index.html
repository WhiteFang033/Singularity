           <pl>Hola Mates! I am Shashank, also know as WhiteFang. I reside in Lucknow, India. I am a teenager but I didn't create this website to provide you all my details...so let's move on...
           </pl>
           <p>I welcome you all to my website "Singularity", this is the second original website I created. The purpose of this website is still unknown but soon it will be decided.  </p>
           <br>
           <br>
           <h1>Making of The Website</h1>
           <br>
           <pl>It was only yesterday (April 29, 2021) when my first original website titled "Webbsite" got hosted by Github Pages and got its web address. After that, I showed it to my mates... One of my mates gave me a pretty clever idea (hehe I won't disclose it) which required the use of JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets(CSS). Then my "Nevla(Mongoose)" friend aka Solemn suggested me to make it look more attractive and comfortable to read. I thought about it and searched for a CSS tutorial on Youtube. I got an idea of how to code in CSS but for the first time it was pretty tough I think so... I had problems in connecting the CSS file and the HTML one, the alignment of the logo, and the setting up of the background picture was a tough thing to do...But finally, My Website was ready to go, I just had to type the content(I'm typing it right now lol) and assign links to the top right buttons. The final task was to upload it to the Github repository and Done Ta-da... I think you are reading this right now...read read it's good....</pl>
